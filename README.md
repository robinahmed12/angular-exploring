# Angular Fundamentals Practice 🚀

This repository contains my hands-on practice with **Angular fundamentals**, including component interaction, directives, pipes, forms (template-driven & reactive), services, HTTP client operations, and more.
It’s built as a personal learning and experimentation project to strengthen my understanding of core Angular concepts.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Core Angular Concepts

* Components & Modules
* Data Binding (Interpolation, Property, Event, Two-Way)
* Directives (Structural & Attribute)
* Component Communication (Input, Output, ViewChild)
* Lifecycle Hooks
* Content Projection (Single, Multi-slot)

### 🔹 Forms

* Template-driven Forms
* Reactive Forms (with `FormBuilder`, `FormGroup`, and `Validators`)
* Custom Form Validation
* Form Submission Handling

### 🔹 Services & Dependency Injection

* Creating and Injecting Services
* Using `@Injectable` for data sharing
* LocalStorage CRUD operations

### 🔹 Pipes

* Built-in Pipes (`date`, `uppercase`, etc.)
* Custom Pipes (e.g., `shortend`, `filter`)

### 🔹 Directives

* Custom Attribute Directive (`HighlightDirective`)
* Understanding `Renderer2` and `ElementRef`

### 🔹 HTTP Client

* Making GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests
* Using `HttpClientModule`
* Integrating with **TheMealDB API**
* Handling Observables and RxJS operators
* Displaying Toastr Notifications

### 🔹 Other Features

* Routing and Navigation
* Toastr Notifications with `ngx-toastr`
* Browser Animations
* Tailwind CSS styling (purple-themed UI)
